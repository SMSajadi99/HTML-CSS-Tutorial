# HTML-CSS-Tutorial
For some of us, the thought of designing a website from scratch can seem like a really daunting task. The irony of it is that for most of us, websites form part of our daily life. The same way the internet connects us, there are special web languages that work together to make up the internet and the websites it contains. HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together to form the front-end design of a website by applying information that affects content, style and interactivity of a site.

## So there’s more than just one web language?

There are many web languages available, however we’re just going to look at three of them. They are HTML, CSS and JavaScript and they are considered to be the backbone of the web. When it comes to web development there is front-end web development and back end-web development. These three languages are for front-end web development and are responsible for what you can see and do on a website. They are referred to as client side languages as they run in the browser (Google Chrome, Firefox etc.) of your computer. The browser translates these languages and the result of this translation is the visual web page.


It’s important to note HTML and CSS are not considered to be programming languages. HTML is a markup language and CSS is a styling language. JavaScript, however, is a programming language. Hence, they are all web languages, but they perform different jobs.

## The Website as a Human Body

To make this easy to understand, I’m going to refer to these three web languages as different aspects of the human body. We’re going to look at the body itself as a sort of command centre; the accessories that are worn on the body as a way of representing personal style; and then the actions that the body is capable of as a way of animating ourselves. So for the purpose of this discussion, HTML will be referred to as the physical body, CSS will be the body’s accessories and JavaScript is the body’s ability to talk or move. All of these ‘bodily aspects’ need to work together to form a functional, visually appealing, interactive website.

## HTML

* The Body
* HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
* Content and basic structure
* Describes and defines
* Made up of tags
* Tells the browser what to display


HyperText Markup Language (HTML) can be broken down into HyperText, which is what grants access to other texts through links, and Markup which outlines the basic structure and appearance of raw text. What this means is that HTML describes and defines the content and basic structure of the website. It does this through a means of special tags or codes which tell the browser what to do. HTML is the bare basics of a website.


An HTML only website can be compared to a functioning human body. Note, I didn’t say fully-functional. An HTML only website has all of its body parts, although it doesn’t offer much to look at because it doesn’t have any accessories or personal style. At this stage, it’s also a body which is not capable of moving or speaking. A website which consists of only HTML would probably look a little like this:


This is where CSS comes in.
